=== Model Details Page ===

Bottom-align tags

Make Other Models thumbnail background/border change on hover

Vertically center images under "other models byâ€¦" 

Check lighter font on other browsers. May be hard to read. 

When user is on the Model Details page of a model they uploaded, there should be an Edit button that takes them to the Edit Model page (use Boostrap "btn btn-mini" with Edit as the label). The button can appear next to the Model Name, or below the "Uploaded by" line if that's easier.

Is progress bar centered properly?


=== Models I Like ===
Get the heart icon to appear in the top right of each thumbnail. When clicked, the heart should "break" (like_heart_broken.png) and the thumbnail should become greyed out. If the page is reloaded, that thumbnail is gone. (If that's too hard, on clicking the heart icon, the thumbnail disappears after a few seconds)

Center heart image in front of headline

Change to My Favorites (in all drop downs and on Models I Like Page)


=== Edit Model I Made ===

Make pop-ups for Delete confirmation and for when a new file has the same name as an existing file

Make one!

Nate: When user "Favorites" a model, the button should maintain the red heart icon, and the model should be added to the user's My Favorites page

Nate: Star ratings on Model Details page should be as described in the comments in that file (like Netflix)

Nate: Make header (and footer) into its own file!

Nate: On sign-up, we need a notification if the user picks an already-taken username

Nate: Clicking OSRF logo once any of the upload fields have been filled in, does NOT take the user to index.html

Nate: On edit_models-I_made, Textarea should not have placeholder text. It should be the real text added previously

Nate: For images, we could use the bootstrap Carousel (Javascript): http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel
