=== Model Details Page ===

Bottom-align tags

Make Other Models thumbnail background/border change on hover

Vertically center images under "other models by…" 

Check lighter font on other browsers. May be hard to read. 

Add Flag and Heart icons at the top

=== Landing Page ===

Increase square bullet size….make custom square!

Evenly space the buttons at the bottom

Is progress bar centered properly?

Next button is not completely right-aligned


=== Models I Like ===
Models are not left-aligned

Get the heart icon to appear in the top right of each thumbnail. When the clicked, the heart should "break" and the thumbnail should become slightly greyed out. On refresh or page revisit, the thumbnail should no longer be there

Rows of models are too close together

Add heart image in front of headline

== Search Results ==
Thumbnails should span entire page

=== My Downloads ===
Grid pages: thumbnails should span the width of the page

=== Models I Made ===
Thumbnails should left-align

Make pop-ups for Delete confirmation and for when a new file has the same name as an existing file



=== Extra ===

Last breadcrumb option (on all pages) should not be clickable

When user is on the page of a model they uploaded, there should be an Edit button that takes them to the Edit Model page

Make a Footer

Consider making username into a link that displays all of that user's models

Nate: Make header (and footer) into its own file!
Nate: On sign-up, we need a notification if the user picks an already-taken username
Nate: Clicking OSRF logo once any of the upload fields have been filled in, does NOT take the user to index.html
Nate: On edit_models-I_made, Textarea should not have placeholder text. It should be the real text added previously
Nate: For images, we could use the bootstrap Carousel (Javascript): http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel
Nate: Image gallery option: http://css-tricks.com/creating-a-slick-auto-playing-featured-content-slider/
