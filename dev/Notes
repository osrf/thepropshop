Nate: When user "Likes" a model, the button should maintain the red heart icon, and the model should be added to the user's Models I Like page

Nate: Star ratings on Model Details page should be as described in the comments in that file (like Netflix)

Nate: Make header (and footer) into its own file

Nate: On sign-up, we need a notification if the user picks an already-taken username

Nate: Clicking OSRF logo once any of the upload fields have been filled in, does NOT take the user to index.html

Nate: On edit_models-I_made, Textarea should not have placeholder text. It should be the real text added previously

Nate: For images, we could use the bootstrap Carousel (Javascript): http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel

Nate: Image gallery option: http://css-tricks.com/creating-a-slick-auto-playing-featured-content-slider/

Nate: Re: the heart icon in the top right of each thumbnail (on the Models I like page and the Model Details Page). When clicked, the heart should "break" and the thumbnail should become greyed out. If the page is reloaded, that thumbnail is gone. (If that's too hard, on clicking the heart icon, the thumbnail disappears after a few seconds). On the Model Details page, "unliking" should just return the heart to the grey color. 

Nate: On Edit Model I Made page, make pop-ups for Delete confirmation and for when a new file has the same name as an existing file
