=== Model Details Page ===
Ratings stars are very small on Firefox

Possible to left-align the Description text?

Thumbnails should not extend past the hero unit on the right side

"Tags" isn't bold


=== Landing Page ===
Make hover of Categories not change color, just underline

=== Models I Made ===
Link shouldn't be blue

=== Upload ===

=== Models I Like ===
Just to be sure, click on the thumbnail (but not on the heart), should take you to that Model Details page

Link shouldn't be blue 

=== Edit Model I Made ===
On Chrome, section headers are not bold. Font seems different.

=== My Downloads ===
Category links should just underline, not be different color

=== Search Results ===

(7) is no longer properly aligned, in Chrome

=== Drop down ===
Can we put the red heart in place of black?

=== Upload 1-3 ==
Small headers aren't bold. Font looks different, in Chrome

Upload 2: Add a line break before Category checkboxes

"If you don't see 'the' categoryâ€¦"??

Upload 3: add link to Apache 2 license (if that's what we'll use)






Nate: On sign-in.html, use only the header drop down code. The contents on the bottom part of the page are outdated.

Nate: When user "Likes" a model, the button should maintain the red heart icon, and the model should be added to the user's Models I Like page

Nate: Star ratings on Model Details page should be as described in the comments in that file (like Netflix)

Nate: Make header (and footer) into its own file

Nate: On sign-up, we need a notification if the user picks an already-taken username

Nate: Clicking OSRF logo once any of the upload fields have been filled in, does NOT take the user to index.html

Nate: On edit_models-I_made, Textarea should not have placeholder text. It should be the real text added previously

Nate: For images, we could use the bootstrap Carousel (Javascript): http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel

Nate: Image gallery option: http://css-tricks.com/creating-a-slick-auto-playing-featured-content-slider/

Nate: Re: the heart icon in the top right of each thumbnail (on the Models I like page and the Model Details Page). When clicked, the heart should "break" and the thumbnail should become greyed out. If the page is reloaded, that thumbnail is gone. (If that's too hard, on clicking the heart icon, the thumbnail disappears after a few seconds). On the Model Details page, "unliking" should just return the heart to the grey color. 

Nate: On Edit Model I Made page, make pop-ups for Delete confirmation and for when a new file has the same name as an existing file

Nate: When user is uploading a model, or editing one they have previously added, they are only allowed to select three categories.
